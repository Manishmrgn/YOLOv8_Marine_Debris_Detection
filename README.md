# UAV Coastal Debris Detection Dataset (YOLOv8-ready)

Dataset accompanying the paper **“UAV-Based Coastal Debris Detection: Analyzing the Effectiveness of Enhanced YOLOv8 for Improved Aerial Surveillance.”**

**Annotation policy:** All annotations were created **in-house** by our team.  
No crowdsourcing. No auto-labeling.

## Overview

This repository hosts a curated UAV aerial imagery dataset focused on **coastal debris**.  
Images were captured via low-altitude UAV flights along beaches and near-shore waters and
are split into train/val/test. Labels are in **YOLO format**.

- **Modality:** RGB UAV stills and frame-grabs  
- **Task:** Object detection (coastal debris)  
- **Intended use:** Debris detection, environmental monitoring, aerial vision research  
- **QA:** Multi-pass review for tight boxes and class consistency
